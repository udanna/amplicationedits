**Front End**

Hi all, I would like to share with you an open-source project that we are working on, that is designed for developers to create server‑side applications, without coding. 

In many projects we found ourselves spending too much time working on repetitive server-side tasks that don't add any actual value to the project.

The tool we are developing, allows you to easily define your application's data models, and automatically generates the server-side code (node.js) for your application. 

You can deploy your application in one click to our cloud or download your application source code and continue on your own.

The project is at an early stage, and we will be happy to get your feedback and ideas on how to improve.

**Back End**

Hi all, I would like to share with you an open-source project that we are working on, that is designed for developers to create server‑side applications, automatically.

In many projects we found ourselves spending too much time working on repetitive server-side tasks that don't add any actual value to the project.

The tool we are developing, allows you to easily define your application's data models, and automatically generates the server-side code (TypeScript node.js with PostgreSQL) which you can download, and modify easily. 

The generated code is high quality human readable code (you can put that to the test...). You can deploy your app in one click to our cloud or download a Docker container to deploy elsewhere.

The project is at an early stage, and we will be happy to get your feedback and ideas on how to improve.
