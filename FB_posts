**Front End**

Hi all, 
I'd like to share with you an open-source project we're working on that's designed for developers called 'amplication'. It's really neat and lets you create server‑side applications without coding. 

In many projects we find ourselves spending lots of time working on repetitive server-side tasks that don't add any actual value to the project. Which is not the best use of the time we have on this planet...

The tool we're developing lets you easily define your application's data models and automatically generates the server-side code (node.js) for your application. 

You can deploy your application to our cloud (in one click!), or download your application source code and continue on your own.

The project is in an early stage of development and we'll be happy to get your feedback and ideas on how to improve.

Hi all, 
I'd like to share with you an open-source project we're working on that's designed for developers called 'amplication'. It's really neat -- it creates server‑side applications, automatically.

In many projects we find ourselves spending lots of time working on repetitive server-side tasks that don't add any actual value to the project. Which is not the best use of the time we have on this planet...

The tool we're developing lets you easily define your application's data models and automatically generates the server-side code (TypeScript node.js with PostgreSQL) which you can download and change as needed. 

The generated code is high quality, human readable code (you can put that to the test...). Your generated app can be deployed (in one click!) to our cloud, or downloaded in a Docker container that you can deploy elsewhere.

The project is in an early stage of development and we'll be happy to get your feedback and ideas on how to improve.
